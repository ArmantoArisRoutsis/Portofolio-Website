            <p className="about-info">Economics Student at the Athens University Of Economics And Business, 
            interested in Econometrics and Data Analysis. I am a highly motivated individual 
            with a primary objective to continuously expand my knowledge. I am eager to use Economic 
            Theory, as well as Statistical and Econometric techniques in order to draw meaningful conclusions from Data.
            <br/><br/>
            I have a deep passion for language learning and at the moment speak three languages (English, Greek and Chinese) and 
            I am currently learning German. I am also passionate about programming and I spend a big part of my free time 
            cultivating my coding skills and learning new programing languages and libraries. At the moment I am at a respectable 
            level in both Python and R programming languages. I have worked with both of them quite a lot and build 
            projects that further helped me improve my skills and understanding of many programming concepts.
