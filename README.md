# Portofolio Website

## About

###### This is Personal Portofolio Website. I created this website using mainly React. I tried to avoid using a lot of external libraries. Most of the animations where made with the use of css except for certain ones(the text fading in from above) where I used the React AOS library. I also used bootstrap for the Navigation Bar. Buttons and the Project card were created by me and are all reusable components which I have used all over the Website again and again. If you wish to view the live version of this website you can do so by visiting this address: https://chronas-vasileios.web.app
